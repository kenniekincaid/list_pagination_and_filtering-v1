# Pagination-and-Filtering-Project
Unit 2 Project (official)

This 'List Pagination and Filtering project' is about manipulating an HTML document in the DOM so it shows only 10 results per page, per clickable navigation button, while all other remains hidden under their respective navigation buttons until that button is clicked.

I am shooting for and 'Exceeds Expectation' grade with this assignment; however, due to time constraints, a 'Meets Expectations' grade will be okay.
