# Pagination-and-Filtering-Project
Unit 2 Project (official)

This 'List Pagination and Filtering project' is about manipulating an HTML document in the DOM so it shows only 10 results per page, per clickable navigation button, while all other entries remain hidden under their respective navigation buttons until called with a user click.

I am shooting for a 'Meets Expectations' grade at this point.
