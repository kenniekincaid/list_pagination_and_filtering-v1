# Pagination-and-Filtering-Project
Unit 2 Project (official)

This 'List Pagination and Filtering project' is about manipulating an HTML document in the DOM so it shows only 10 results per page, per clickable navigation button, while all other entries remain hidden under their respective navigation buttons until called with a user click.

In order to complete this project I had to create variables, loops, events, do some dynamic coding in order to refrain from making changes to the HTML tab for things that could have easily been done there rather than in the JS tab.

I am shooting for a 'Meets Expectations' grade at this point. I was going to attempt the 'Exceeds Expectations' with a search bar, but it showed up in the wrong place, it's the end of the day, and the deadline has been reached.
